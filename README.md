# Pathfinding Visualizer
This _python_ application visually shows how different algorithms solve the [shortest path problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem), which is the problem of finding a path between two vertices (or nodes) in a graph such that the sum of the weights of its constituent edges is minimized. These algorithms are visualized in a grid (instead of a graph), where the weight of each edge is equal to 1.
